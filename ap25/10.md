head, heart, hands, aligns with the gospel waltz


1. Head: Peacekeeping vs Peacemaking

"Conflict resolution is the process of settling a disagreement or dispute between two or more parties by finding a mutually acceptable solution."

"Gospel-centered conflict resolution is the process of resolving disagreements and disputes that is rooted in the Gospel. It emphasizes applying the grace and forgiveness of the Gospel to interpersonal conflicts, seeking reconciliation and unity rather than retribution or escalation."

The peacekeeper is someone who tries to avoid constructive conflict by withdrawing or attacking, and often ends up in deeper conflict."

The peacemaker takes into account that life always involves struggle, and that at the heart of this conflict is a 'love offensive' in relationship to others.


2. Heart: The Prince of Peace
