How

Three Circles

God's Design
We were created in God's image and in perfect relationship with him. We were designed to worship and walk with God
Genesis 1:31

-> sin
Sin entered the world and the perfect relationship between man and God was broken
Romans 6:23
Romans 3:23

Brokenness
Sin leads us to a place of brokenness. Brokeness leads us to a place of realizing our need for something greater
Romans 1:23

-> Repent & Believe
Repent: acknowledging and turning from our sin
Believe: Trusting that God is who he says he is

By repenting and believing, we receive new life in Jesus and God turns our lives in a NEW DIRECTION
Romans 10:9
Ephesians 2:8-9

Gospel
Because of his love for us, God sent his son Jesus to live the perfect human life according to God's design, never giving into sin and to do what we could not do for ourselves - reconcile us to God
Romans 6:23

-> Recover & Pursue
Because of our faith in Jesus, we can return to God's original design for our lives: to worship him and to walk with him
2 Corinthians 5:17
Philippians 2:13
Romans 10:9
