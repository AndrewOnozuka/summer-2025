Identifying Idolatry | Sam Collins

Sin isn't only doing bad things; it's more fundamentally making good things into ultimate things. Sin is building your life and meaning on anything, even a very good thing, more than on God. Whatever we build our life on will drive us and enslave us. Sin is primarily idolatry.

"an idol is anything in our lives that occupies the place that should be occupied by God alone."
Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones

"A desire for a good thing becomes a desire for a bad thing when that desire becomes a ruling thing... If you are not attaching your identity to the unshakeable love of your Savior, you will ask the things in your life to be your Savior."
Paul David Tripp
