Gospel Waltz    Aaron Truong

what is gospel waltz

What is a waltz?

a dance in triple time performed by a couple, who as a pairtum rhythmically around and around as they progress around the dance floor

Gospel Waltz
1. a framework to grow and be transformed in your Christian walk
2. incorporated as a healthy rhythm of your life
3. meant to be done both individually and with others

1. Repent
2 Chronicles 7:14

Ask:
- what sin do i need to own and repent of
- what is the sin beneath my sin? (pride, unbelief, selfishness, etc.)
- why do I love to disobey in this area?
- how is this offensive to God and how have I grieved the Holy Spirit?

2 Corinthians 7:10

2. Believe
Romans 8:1-2

Ask:
- what did Jesus do for me regarding this sin?
- how does Christ give me so much more of what I am looking for elsewhere?
- What specific promises of God do I need to believe?
- how does Christ love me here
- 

Preach the Gospel to yourself

3. Obey
James 2?

Belief should lead to action

Ask:
- how is the Holy Spirit moving me towards love and good works?
- how am I called to obey in this situation
- what means of grace do I need? (the body, the word, ??)

Without repentance
Our faith becomes moralistic. We are trying to earn God's approval with good works

Without belief
Our faith becomes one of fear. We forget the Gospel???

Without obedience:
We take the cross for granted. The same sins persist in our stagnant hearts.

Application

Waltz with God and other people!

James 5:16
